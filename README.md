## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I come from a research background ðŸ§ª with hands-on experience building open source software ðŸ’». I earned my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science, where my work on trustworthy machine learning earned a Spotlight acceptance at NeurIPS 2024 [(Link)](https://nips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/95529). You can find more about my work and projects here and on my webpage (link on the left).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m now looking to transition into a more engineering-focused roleâ€”ideally at an early- to mid-stage startup where I can have a tangible impact on growth. While much of my recent work has been in ML research on security and privacy, what truly drives me is engineering: building scalable systems and solving complex, ambiguous problems. That passion is what led me to study computer science and engineering in the first place, and itâ€™s what I want to focus on in the years ahead. I value engineering cultures that foster both personal and professional growth, and Iâ€™m open to working across domains as long as the product is compelling, the team is strong and dynamic, and thereâ€™s room to learn and make an impact.

ðŸ”­ To support this shift, Iâ€™ve been diving into side projects to sharpen my systems design skillsâ€”combining reading with small-scale builds to better understand trade-offs and architectural choices. Iâ€™m especially interested in infrastructure and system-level challenges in deploying large language models (LLMs) at scale. Recently, I built an LLM cache to intercept and reuse responses for repeated or similar queries, cutting down on redundant computation and improving inference latency.

<!-- One of the projects that I am building along these lines is an open-source . Itâ€™s implemented in Python with Redis as the backend, and includes support for semantic similarity search. Through this project, Iâ€™m diving into trade-offs in cache design and performance across different workloads. Exploring how these low and high level system optimizations directly impact real-world latency and throughput is something Iâ€™m really excited about, and Iâ€™m currently looking to contribute to projects or teams that operate at intersection of high-performance systems and cutting-edge ML.
