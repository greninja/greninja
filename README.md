## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a strong foundation in research ðŸ§ª, with some experience building software ðŸ’» under my belt. I earned my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from UBC (Vancouver), where my research focused on trustworthy machine learning, leading to a Spotlight acceptance at a top-tier Machine Learning Conference, NeurIPS'24 [(Link)](https://nips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/95529). For more details on my background and projects, please visit my webpage (link on the left).

ðŸ”­ During my masterâ€™s, I was part of a Systems research lab that naturally led me to develop a deep interest in the intersection of Systems and Deep Learning. Over time, this interest has evolved, and I now find myself particularly drawn to the infrastructure and system-level challenges that come with deploying large language models (LLMs) in production. Iâ€™m especially fascinated by the components that make LLM inference faster. For instance, I am currently looking at caching layers, optimized scheduling and batching techniques, speculative decoding and attention mechanism optimizations via CUDA. 

One of the projects that I am building along these lines is an open-source LLM cache -- designed to intercept and reuse responses for repeated or similar queries, cutting down on redundant computation. Itâ€™s implemented in Python with Redis as the backend, and includes support for prompt normalization, flexible cache invalidation, and plans for token-level prefix matching. Through this project, Iâ€™m diving into trade-offs in cache design and performance across different workloads. Exploring how these low and high level system optimizations directly impact real-world latency and throughput is something Iâ€™m really excited about, and Iâ€™m currently looking to contribute to projects or teams that operate at this intersection of high-performance systems and cutting-edge ML.
 
ðŸŒ± Additionally, as I move forward in my career, Iâ€™m particularly drawn to early to mid-stage startups where I can contribute to meaningful growth. I highly value a strong, dynamic founding team and an engineering culture that promotes both personal and professional development. Iâ€™m open to exploring different domains, as long as the product and roadmap are compelling, the team is solid, and thereâ€™s significant opportunity for learning and growth. If you think Iâ€™d be a great fit, feel free to reach out!
