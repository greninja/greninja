## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a strong foundation in research ðŸ§ª, with some experience building software ðŸ’» as well under my belt. I recently earned my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from UBC (Vancouver), where my work  focused on trustworthy machine learning, leading to a Spotlight acceptance at a top-tier Machine Learning Conference, NeurIPS'24 [(Link)](https://nips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/95529). For more details on my background and projects, visit my webpage (link on the left).

As I move forward in my career, Iâ€™m excited to transition into an industry-focused role as a software or machine learning engineer. Iâ€™m particularly drawn to early to mid-stage startups where I can contribute to meaningful growth. I highly value a strong, dynamic founding team and a culture that promotes both personal and professional development. Iâ€™m open to exploring different domains, as long as the product and roadmap are compelling, the team is solid, and thereâ€™s significant opportunity for learning and growth. If you think Iâ€™d be a great fit, feel free to reach out!
