## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## &#x1f4c8; GitHub Stats

I have experience doing research :test_tube: and building softwares :computer: under my belt. I recently earned my Masters from UBC. My work was broadly in the space of trustworthy machine learning. You can check more details about me on my webpage (on the left).

For my next steps in my career, I am looking to switch gears into a more industry-focused software or machine learning engineer role. I am quite excited to be part of a mid to early stage startup, and to contribute to it's growth. I highly value a strong, solid founding team with a culture conducive for personal and professional growth. Please feel free to reach out if you think I can be a good fit for your team.
