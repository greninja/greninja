## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## &#x1f4c8; GitHub Stats

I have a solid foundation in research ðŸ§ª, with some experience building softwares ðŸ’» as well under my belt. I recently earned my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from UBC (Vancouver), where I  focused on trustworthy machine learning, leading to a publication (spotlight) at NeurIPS'24 [(Link)](https://nips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/95529).  For more details on my background and projects, visit my webpage (link on the left)."

As I move forward in my career, I'm excited to transition into a more industry-focused role as a software or machine learning engineer. I'm particularly interested in joining an early to mid-stage startup where I can contribute to the company's growth. I value a strong, dynamic founding team and a culture that fosters both personal and professional development. If you think Iâ€™d be a great fit for your team, feel free to get in touch!"
